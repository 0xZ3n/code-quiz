# code-quiz
## Multiple choice quiz on JavaScript fundamentals, stores score with initials

### This program was meant to be a quiz in which questions and possible answers would have been dynamically appended to (and subesequently cleared form) the screen. This would have been achieved by accessing elements within an array titled "questions" and the selected answer would have been compared to the object element called "correct" within the questions array.

### Unfortunately, I am unable to get any further than having the clickEvent of an answer be recognized, which i was simply able to console log. I don't understand why I keep receieving errors that my functions are not recognized. I will be resubmitting this as soon as I receive feedback.
